@0 = ~Oops.~
@1 = ~No, Raptair! He was about t- you shot h- you-!~
@2 = ~I know. It's sad. We suffer consequences for the decisions we make. He died because he is a runaway slave, and because you crossed me.~
@3 = ~No more running! I will see you dead before you try to escape.~
@4 = ~You have taken too many lives. Your life is forfeit!~
@5 = ~Your soul is damned, Laravyl. I will see to it myself.~
@6 = ~I do not intend to run. When I am done with you, Yaga-shura promises a host of slaves of whoever isn't slaughtered in the siege. This is path of both my vengeance and the recovery of our slave trade.~
@7 = ~You will never get the chance! I will...I will kill you! I will kill you all!~
@8 = ~We shall see.~

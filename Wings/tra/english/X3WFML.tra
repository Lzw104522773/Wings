@0 = ~What are you doing here? This is my bedroom. Get out or be forced out.~
@1 = ~Too bad. You have something we want.~
@2 = ~Oh, a pity. I thought we might find Laravyl here.~
@3 = ~Sorry, I must have the wrong room.~
@4 = ~Wait a minute. You're the ones who have been causing us so much trouble in the slums. Men, come out of the shadows and kill them! This will get me a quick promotion to Praxis's right hand above that bitch, Laravyl!~
@5 = ~I don't want to hear that damn Laravyl's name! Praxis's favorite my arse, I do all the work! Wait a minute...I know who you are. Men, come out of the shadows and kill them! Their lives are forfeit for what they did in the slums.~
@6 = ~What, you think I am alone? Fool! Men, come out of the shadows and kill them! And make it painful as possible.~
@7 = ~Where is m- I've been robbed! It must have been them. Come out from the shadows and take their heads!~
